Hi Aunty, 

I am starting a new CS school named Headstart that is running two classes starting in March. The focus of the classes is very different from the programming classes you're used to seeing. We're focusing on teaching students practical and real-world skills that will enable them to build products and applications from scratch. 

We also provide strong continued mentorship after the class is done, and have a network of extremely talented people to help students find internships, give career advice, and help in any way possible. 

We're running two classes: one for beginners, and one for students with previous programming knowledge. In both classes, students will build multiple projects and one cumulative final project (like an Instagram clone).

I think ____ would be a great fit for the beginner class, and would love to talk more about whether it'll be a good fit for him! Would you like to talk on a call?
